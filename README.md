The code comprises of a merger of various functions created during an online course.
The functions have been consolidated using Python object Oriented Programming(class) to build a banking system that can be transformed into an application.

Users can sign up, log in and delete their account with the system. 
They can also update their bank account balance and transfer money to another user’s bank account.
Implementing functions related to File I/O and dictionaries,
The first two functions imports files and create dictionaries by importing user information from the “users.txt” file and account information from the “bank.txt” file. 
The remaining functions make use/modify the two dictionaries created from the files.
